# RevisionDojo-Tools

## Overview

This repository contains foundational infrastructure developed to support educational content extraction, structuring, and management for online learning platforms.

The tools in this monorepo directly contributed to the early-stage backend operations of **RevisionDojo**, a platform that later became a **Y Combinator-backed company**.  
This work formed part of the technical foundation that supported RevisionDojoâ€™s successful YC application and early operational scaling.

The primary focus is on high-efficiency web scraping, data cleaning, and structured JSON output for curriculum databases.

## Contents

- **Web Scraper**: Node.js-based scrapers that extract curriculum data from educational websites using Axios and Cheerio.
- **Data Structuring**: Functions to organize extracted syllabus data into structured JSON formats (curriculum names, subjects, subtopics).
- **Syllabus Automation**: Scripts to mass-scrape and standardize GMAT, A-Level, and OpenAI-hosted syllabi.
